# PPDs
A collection of PPDs I came across which may be redistributed.

UTAX licenses its PPDs under a MIT license, which is nice of them. Unfortunately the PPDs are not included in foomatic.

For the "old" TA350ci I needed the PPDs and saw that they may be shared, so I share them as they may be withdrawn by the manufacturer as
the small copy monster is old and "end of life"
