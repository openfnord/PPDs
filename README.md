# PPDs
A collection of PPDs I came across which may be redistributed.

UTAX licenses its PPDs under a MIT license, which is nice of them. Unfortunately the PPDs are not included in foomatic.

For the "old" TA350ci I needed the PPDs and saw that they may be shared, so I share them as they may be withdrawn by the manufacturer as
the small copy monster is old and "end of life"

â€¦fortunately the PPDs are not included in foomatic.

By the way ...
The Default Admin password for the TA350ci is 3500:
user: 3500
pass: 3500
The Service Menu can be entered from the main view using the code:
10871087
Here you can destroy everything:-) 
Helpful is printing colored registration pages for the printing unit which are to be scanned by the build-in scanner to optimize the printer color alignment.

For those folks who do not believe in me telling you that the PPDs of UTAX are MIT-licensed, please look here or ask your favorite search engine:
